# EventViewer Rules System Documentation

## Overview

The PSEventViewer project uses a unified rule system where **all event definitions are directly embedded in EventRuleBase classes**, eliminating the need for separate event ID mappings, manual registration, or hybrid approaches. The system uses pure reflection to automatically discover and register all event rules.

## How It Works

### Unified EventRuleBase Approach

All event rules now inherit from `EventRuleBase` and define their metadata directly in the class:

```csharp
namespace EventViewerX.Rules.ActiveDirectory;

/// <summary>
/// Active Directory Computer Created or Changed
/// 4741: A computer account was created
/// 4742: A computer account was changed
/// </summary>
public class ADComputerCreateChange : EventRuleBase {
    public override List<int> EventIds => new() { 4741, 4742 };
    public override string LogName => "Security";
    public override NamedEvents NamedEvent => NamedEvents.ADComputerCreateChange;

    public override bool CanHandle(EventObject eventObject) {
        // Simple rule - always handle if event ID and log name match
        return true;
    }

    public ADComputerCreateChange(EventObject eventObject) : base(eventObject) {
        // Initialize properties from eventObject
        Type = "ADComputerCreateChange";
        // ... your processing logic
    }
}
```

### Complex Rules with Conditions

For rules that need specific conditions, implement custom logic in `CanHandle`:

```csharp
namespace EventViewerX.Rules.ActiveDirectory;

/// <summary>
/// Active Directory Computer Change Detailed - only for computer objects
/// </summary>
public class ADComputerChangeDetailed : EventRuleBase {
    public override List<int> EventIds => new() { 5136, 5137, 5139, 5141 };
    public override string LogName => "Security";
    public override NamedEvents NamedEvent => NamedEvents.ADComputerChangeDetailed;

    public override bool CanHandle(EventObject eventObject) {
        // Only handle computer object changes
        return eventObject.Data.TryGetValue("ObjectClass", out var objectClass) &&
               objectClass == "computer";
    }

    public ADComputerChangeDetailed(EventObject eventObject) : base(eventObject) {
        // Initialize properties from eventObject
        Type = "ADComputerChangeDetailed";
        // ... your processing logic
    }
}
```

## Adding New Event Rules

### Step 1: Add to NamedEvents Enum
Add your new event type to the `NamedEvents` enum in `Enums\NamedEvents.cs`:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Your new event description
/// </summary>
YourNewEvent,
```

### Step 2: Create the EventRuleBase Class

All rules use the same EventRuleBase pattern:

```csharp
namespace EventViewerX.Rules.YourCategory;

/// <summary>
/// Description of your event rule
/// Event IDs: 1234, 5678
/// </summary>
public class YourNewEvent : EventRuleBase {
    public override List<int> EventIds => new() { 1234, 5678 };
    public override string LogName => "YourLogName";
    public override NamedEvents NamedEvent => NamedEvents.YourNewEvent;

    public override bool CanHandle(EventObject eventObject) {
        // For simple rules that handle all matching events:
        return true;

        // For complex rules with conditions:
        // return eventObject.Data.TryGetValue("SomeField", out var value) &&
        //        value == "ExpectedValue";
    }

    public YourNewEvent(EventObject eventObject) : base(eventObject) {
        Type = "YourNewEvent";
        // Initialize your properties from eventObject
        // Property1 = eventObject.GetValueFromDataDictionary("DataField");
        // Property2 = eventObject.ComputerName;
        // When = eventObject.TimeCreated;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: That's It!

The system will automatically:
- âœ… Discover your rule class using reflection
- âœ… Extract event IDs and log name from your rule
- âœ… Register the rule for automatic processing
- âœ… Use your `CanHandle` method to determine when to create instances
- âœ… Query the correct logs and create rule instances as needed

**No manual registration required!**

## System Architecture

### Automatic Discovery Process

1. **Assembly Scanning**: At startup, the system scans for all classes inheriting from `EventRuleBase`
2. **Rule Registration**: For each rule class, creates a temporary instance to extract metadata:
   - `EventIds` â†’ List of event IDs the rule handles
   - `LogName` â†’ Windows Event Log name to query
   - `NamedEvent` â†’ Enum value linking to the rule
3. **Event Processing**: When processing events, the system:
   - Creates rule instances for matching events
   - Calls `CanHandle()` to validate the rule should process this specific event
   - Returns the rule instance if conditions are met

### No Manual Mappings Required

The system uses **pure reflection** with no hardcoded mappings:
- Event IDs and log names come directly from rule properties
- Rule conditions are evaluated by the rules themselves
- New rules are automatically discovered on startup

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Event IDs, log names, and conditions are defined once in the rule class
2. **Automatic Discovery**: Zero configuration - just create the rule class and it's discovered
3. **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking ensures all rules are properly configured
4. **Extensibility**: Add new rules without touching any central configuration
5. **Maintainability**: Event definitions live with their processing logic
6. **Self-Documenting**: Rules clearly show what events they handle and how
7. **Consistent**: All rules use the same EventRuleBase pattern
8. **Testable**: Each rule can be unit tested independently

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed
- âœ… **Unified EventRuleBase System**: All rules now use the same consistent pattern
- âœ… **Pure Reflection Discovery**: Automatic rule discovery with zero manual mappings
- âœ… **30+ Rules Migrated**: All existing rules converted to EventRuleBase
- âœ… **Manual Mappings Eliminated**: No more hardcoded event ID or rule mappings
- âœ… **Build Validation**: System compiles and works with unified approach

### ðŸŽ¯ Current State
The system is **fully operational** with the unified EventRuleBase approach:
- All event rules inherit from EventRuleBase
- All metadata is auto-detected from rule classes
- No manual registration or mapping required
- Consistent behavior across simple and complex rules

### ðŸ“Š Rule Examples
- **Simple Rules**: `ADComputerCreateChange`, `ADUserLogonFailed` (return `true` in CanHandle)
- **Complex Rules**: `ADComputerChangeDetailed`, `ADUserLogonNTLMv1` (custom conditions in CanHandle)
- **All Rules**: Use same EventRuleBase pattern with override properties

## Example Usage

The system works seamlessly with existing code:

```csharp
// This automatically uses the new reflection-based system
await foreach (var eventObject in SearchEvents.FindEventsByNamedEvents([
    NamedEvents.ADComputerCreateChange,
    NamedEvents.ADComputerChangeDetailed,
    NamedEvents.ADUserLogonFailed,
    NamedEvents.ADLdapBindingDetails
])) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Found event: {eventObject.Type} from {eventObject.GatheredFrom}");
}
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

1. **Query Planning**: System extracts event IDs and log names from each rule:
   ```csharp
   ADComputerCreateChange: EventIds=[4741, 4742], LogName="Security"
   ADUserLogonFailed: EventIds=[4625], LogName="Security"
   ADLdapBindingDetails: EventIds=[2889], LogName="Directory Service"
   ```

2. **Log Querying**: Groups by log name and queries efficiently:
   ```csharp
   Query "Security" log for events: 4741, 4742, 4625
   Query "Directory Service" log for events: 2889
   ```

3. **Rule Processing**: For each event found:
   ```csharp
   var rule = new ADComputerCreateChange(eventObject);
   if (rule.CanHandle(eventObject)) {
       return rule; // This specific rule handles this event
   }
   ```

4. **Result**: Returns properly typed, processed event objects with all rule-specific logic applied.

## Key Files

- **`EventRuleBase.cs`**: Abstract base class all rules inherit from
- **`IEventRule.cs`**: Interface defining the CanHandle contract
- **`EventObjectSlim.cs`**: Reflection-based discovery and rule creation system
- **`SearchEvents.NamedEventsDetails.cs`**: Updated to use reflection system
- **`Rules/`**: Directory containing all EventRuleBase rule implementations

The system automatically:
1. âœ… Discovers event IDs and log names from rule classes
2. âœ… Queries the appropriate logs efficiently
3. âœ… Creates the correct rule instances based on conditions
4. âœ… Returns properly typed event objects with rule-specific processing
