# PSEventViewer - PowerShell Module

## Description

This module was built for a project of Events Reporting. As it was a bit inefficient, I've decided to rewrite it and split reading events to separate modules.
While underneath it's just a wrapper over `Get-WinEvent`, it does add few tweaks here and there...

The project was split into 2 parts:

- `PSEventViewer` - this module.
- [PSWinReporting](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting) - reporting on Active Directory Events, Windows Events...

### Why PSEventViewer?

By default in PowerShell we have couple of cmdlets that let you do different things:

- [x] Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics
    - [x] `Get-WinEvent`
    - [x] `New-WinEvent`

- [x] Microsoft.PowerShell.Management - The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun, the EventLog cmdlets, work only on classic event logs. 
    - [x] `Clear-EventLog` - Clears all of the entries from the specified event logs on the local or remote computers.  
    - [x] `Get-EventLog -list` - alternative to `Get-WmiObject win32_nteventlogfile` - lists event logs 
    - [x] `Get-EventLog` - Gets the events in the event log that match the specified criteria.
    - [x] `Limit-EventLog` - Sets the event log properties that limit the size of the event log and the age of its entries.
    - [x] `New-EventLog` - Creates a new event log and a new event source on a local or remote computer.
    - [x] `Remove-EventLog` - Deletes an event log or unregisters an event source.
    - [x] `Show-EventLog` - Displays the event logs of the local or a remote computer in Event Viewer.

Our module tries to improve on that by providing a bit more flexibility and speed, and also by providing a bit more information about the events.

### Example for -RecordID (added in 0.51)

There is a big difference if you ask for `-RecordID` in `FilterXML` a and when you do post-processing of it via Where { }.
And by the huge difference I mean a really huge one. Depending on the amount of Event ID's stored a that you query for...
it may take minutes or even hours to get a single RecordID.
Since -FilterHashTable doesn't allow `RecordID` as parameter, nor `Get-WinEvent` doesn't have the `-RecordID` directly ... one has to use `FilterXML`.
This, as you can see below, speed up the search from `6+ minutes to 141 milliseconds`.

### Registry Entries

Registry entries storing configuration for Events Logs in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\LogName`.
It's not advised to modify registry manually as it can cause issues with the Event Logs.

Using following cmdlets can help

```powershell
Get-EventsSettings -LogName 'Application'
Set-WinEventSettings -LogName 'Application' -MaximumSizeMB 15 -Mode AutoBackup -WhatIf
```

|                     | To be a syntactically valid SDDL, the CustomSD value must specify an owner and a group owner (for example, O:BAG:SY), but the owner and group owner are not used. If CustomSD is set to a wrong value, an event is fired in the System event log when the event log service starts, and the event log gets a default security descriptor which is identical to the original CustomSD value for the Application log.

| Retention           | This value is of type REG_DWORD. The default value is 0. If this value is 0, the records of events are always overwritten. If this value is 0xFFFFFFFF or any nonzero value, records are never overwritten. When the log file reaches its maximum size, you must clear the log manually; otherwise, new events are discarded. You must also clear the log before you can change its size.Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP/2000:Â This value is the time interval, in seconds, that records of events are protected from being overwritten. When the age of an event reaches or exceeds this value, it can be overwritten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| AutoBackupLogFiles  | This value is of type REG_DWORD, and is used by the event log service to determine whether an event log should be automatically saved. The default value is 0, which disables auto-backup. The service will back up the log file only if the retention value is -1 (0xFFFFFFFF). Other values will be ignored.Windows Server 2003:Â Retention can be set to -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) or 1 (0x00000001) for AutoBackupLogFiles to work.

| RestrictGuestAccess | This value is not used.Â Windows XP/2000:Â This value is of type REG_DWORD, and the default value is 1.
