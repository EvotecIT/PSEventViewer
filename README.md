This module was built for a project of Events Reporting. As it was a bit inefficient I've decided to rewrite it and split reading events to separate module.

Project was split into 2 parts:
- PSEventViewer - this module.
- PSWinReporting - reporting on Active Directory Events, Windows Events... generally reporting

Documentation for later is available at: https://evotec.xyz/hub/scripts/get-eventslibrary-ps1/ (link will be updated when new module will be officially released)
