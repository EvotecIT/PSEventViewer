# PSEventViewer - PowerShell Module

## Description

This module was built for a project of Events Reporting. As it was a bit inefficient, I've decided to rewrite it and split reading events to separate modules.
While underneath it's just a wrapper over `Get-WinEvent`, it does add few tweaks here and there...

The project was split into 2 parts:

- `PSEventViewer` - this module.
- [PSWinReporting](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting) - reporting on Active Directory Events, Windows Events...

### Why PSEventViewer?

By default in PowerShell we have couple of cmdlets that let you do different things:

- [x] Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics
    - [x] `Get-WinEvent`
    - [x] `New-WinEvent`

- [x] Microsoft.PowerShell.Management - The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun, the EventLog cmdlets, work only on classic event logs.
    - [x] `Clear-EventLog` - Clears all of the entries from the specified event logs on the local or remote computers.
    - [x] `Get-EventLog -list` - alternative to `Get-WmiObject win32_nteventlogfile` - lists event logs
    - [x] `Get-EventLog` - Gets the events in the event log that match the specified criteria.
    - [x] `Limit-EventLog` - Sets the event log properties that limit the size of the event log and the age of its entries.
    - [x] `New-EventLog` - Creates a new event log and a new event source on a local or remote computer.
    - [x] `Remove-EventLog` - Deletes an event log or unregisters an event source.
    - [x] `Show-EventLog` - Displays the event logs of the local or a remote computer in Event Viewer.

Our module tries to improve on that by providing a bit more flexibility and speed, and also by providing a bit more information about the events.

### Example for -RecordID (added in 0.51)

There is a big difference if you ask for `-RecordID` in `FilterXML` a and when you do post-processing of it via Where { }.
And by the huge difference I mean a really huge one. Depending on the amount of Event ID's stored a that you query for...
it may take minutes or even hours to get a single RecordID.
Since -FilterHashTable doesn't allow `RecordID` as parameter, nor `Get-WinEvent` doesn't have the `-RecordID` directly ... one has to use `FilterXML`.
This, as you can see below, speed up the search from `6+ minutes to 141 milliseconds`.

### Registry Entries

Registry entries storing configuration for Events Logs in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\LogName`.
It's not advised to modify registry manually as it can cause issues with the Event Logs.

Using following cmdlets can help

```powershell
Get-EVXInfo -LogName 'Application'
Set-EVXInfo -LogName 'Application' -MaximumSizeMB 15 -Mode AutoBackup -WhatIf
```
