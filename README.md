# PSEventViewer - PowerShell Module

## Description

This module was built for a project of Events Reporting. As it was a bit inefficient, I've decided to rewrite it and split reading events to separate modules.
While underneath it's just a wrapper over `Get-WinEvent`, it does add few tweaks here and there...

The project was split into 2 parts:

- `PSEventViewer` - this module.
- [PSWinReporting](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWinReporting) - reporting on Active Directory Events, Windows Events...

## Changelog

- 1.0.17 - 2020.05.31
  - Fix for `Get-Events` (use of Path and NamedDataFilter) - provided by [danubie #13](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/pull/13) - solves [#12](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/issues/12)

- 1.0.16 - 2020.05.31
  - Fix for `Get-Events` for NamedDataFilter - provided by [danubie #11](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/pull/11) - solves [#10](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/issues/10)

- 1.0.15 - 2020.05.17
  - Fix for `Get-EventsFilter` - provided by [danubie #9](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/pull/9) - solves [#7](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/issues/7) and [#8](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSEventViewer/issues/8)

- 1.0.14 - 2020.04.11
  - Updates to PSD1

- 1.0.13 - 2020.02.16
  - Added Get-EventsSettings/Set-EventsSettings (Work in progress)

- 1.0.12 - 2020.01.01
  - Added some new aliases

- 1.0.11 - 2019.12.30
  - Added Write-Event

- 1.0.10 - 2019.12.17
  - Path is back. Not sure why it was gone. Need improvements.

- 1.0.9 - 2019.11.12
  - Removed dependency on PSSharedGoods on the published module
  - PSSharedGoods is still dependency, but the building process makes it possible to compile it and push to PSGallery/Releases without that dependency.

- 1.0.7 - 2019.09.12
  - Small changes to Get-EventsInformation

- 0.62 - 2019.01.11
  - Fix for Member Name with a comma inside

- 0.61 - 2019.01.02
  - Multiple new parameters, some new functionality

- 0.51
  - Added -RecordID parameter (currently it only works with LogName + RecordID, you can't use any other parameters with RecordID as it will take LogName + RecordID anyways and crash if it's not there)

- 0.50
  - A version that worked fine :-)

### Example for -RecordID (added in 0.51)

There is a big difference if you ask for `-RecordID` in `FilterXML` a and when you do post-processing of it via Where { }.
And by the huge difference I mean a really huge one. Depending on the amount of Event ID's stored a that you query for...
it may take minutes or even hours to get a single RecordID.
Since -FilterHashTable doesn't allow `RecordID` as parameter, nor `Get-WinEvent` doesn't have the `-RecordID` directly ... one has to use `FilterXML`.
This, as you can see below, speed up the search from `6+ minutes to 141 milliseconds`.
